## About Me

Basic bio info that hopefully show cases who I am at a quick glance. Incorporating into the project the most common elements of both HTML and CSS.

## Tech/Framework used

HTML and CSS and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

## What I learned

Start with simple layout and build upon with pleasing ui. It will most likely be a "work in progress" for as long as I'm still developing.
Practice writing HTML and CSS. Have a rough draft on what you want to accomplish, this can be a drawing on stratch paper. This helps keep you roughly focused on basic composition. Can always change later!
